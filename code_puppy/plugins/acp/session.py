"""``ACPSession`` — one client thread bound to one Code Puppy agent.

Each ACP session id maps to a single ``BaseAgent`` instance whose
``_message_history`` persists across ``session/prompt`` calls, giving native
multi-turn conversations. The session also carries the ``cwd`` the client
opened the thread in, so tools resolve paths relative to the right project.

Cancellation (``session/cancel``) is real: the prompt runs as an
``asyncio.Task`` we hold a handle to, so a cancel notification cancels that
task. pydantic-ai surfaces the ``CancelledError``, which we translate into the
``cancelled`` stop reason for the in-flight ``session/prompt`` reply.

Each turn also reports token usage (mapped from the pydantic-ai run result)
back on the ``PromptResponse`` so the client can show cost/usage.
